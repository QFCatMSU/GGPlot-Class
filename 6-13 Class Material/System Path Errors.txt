System Path Errors:
When a program like Git installs on your computer, it will write it's location to
a "file" on your computer called the System Path.  This is so that other programs, 
like RStudio, that want to use Git can easily find it's location.  

But, System Paths are used inconsistantly with two common problems being:
1) Program not checking for changes in the System Path -- so RStudio might not
   know of an update to Git and it will use an old version 
2) Uninstallers often forget to revert the System Path -- so RStudio might still think
   that Git exists because the System Path still has it even though Git has been
   uninstalled. 
   
There are a lot of similarities to setwd() issues in R!
